# CaseStudiesMachineLearning

Welcome to our case study repository.

This was a project case study on nonlinear optimization. We implemented the Stochastic Quasi-Newton method, the Stochastic Proximal Gradient method and applied both to a dictionary learning problem. 

You will find most of the production source code in the `code/` subdirectory.
